My name is Siddhant Kumar Sahu. I am a Student at MIT Academy of Engineering, Pune. I am a Software Engineering student with a strong curiosity for how real-world problems can be solved through clean, efficient, and scalable software. I enjoy building systems that go beyond theory—whether it’s full-stack applications, data-driven platforms, or AI-powered tools—and I’m constantly exploring how different technologies work together in practice. I believe in learning by building, breaking, and improving, and I’m comfortable adapting to new tools and frameworks as required. Beyond technical skills, I value clear thinking, collaboration, and writing code that is understandable and maintainable. I aim to grow into an engineer who not only develops software, but designs solutions that are meaningful and impactful.
